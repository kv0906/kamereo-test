**Kamereo test**

## How to run (Development)
1.  `npm install`
2. `npm run server` to start json-server for mock API
3. `npm start` to start application browse localhost:3000/stores/:id to access page for store

## Happy-case
1. Work when all input is filled ( including upload image )
    - Fetch list store
    - Fetch store detail
    - Edit store profile
## Limitation
1. Did not cover feature auto delete image after a period of time
2. City and district is still hardcoded not fetch from specific list
3. Did not validate store image upload
